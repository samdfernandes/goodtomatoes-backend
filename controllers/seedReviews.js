    //     rating: 5,
    //     reviewNotes: "The entire series began well, became amazing, and then somewhere began to stumble, only to catch itself to keep from hitting the ground, ending upright, tall, and with much to be proud of. Few shows will ever hook us the way the Office characters did thanks to the outstanding performances of the best and most devoted ensemble of actors a television show could ever hope for."

    //     rating: 4,
    //     reviewNotes: "My best friend and I both love this - the humor, the no-holds philosophic critique, the wonderful acting, the growing and deeping relationships, the alternate universes, the fun with Dante and Kierkegaard and the major faiths... which then begins to circle back just about when you think you see where you're being led. Great fodder for moral discussion, or comedic relief."

    //     reviewNotes: "Unbelievably great! In our family, some are big fans of Tolkien, some didn't care for the books. This film managed to delight both camps. As for me, I started the movie fully expecting to walk away and find something else to do, because I easily get turned off/bored by action movies and violence. This time, I was glued to the screen for the whole 3 hours. Although there are violent scenes, the editing is so skillful, that I never got to my usual 'OK, I get the point. . . move on'"

    //     title: 'Jaws: Classic! Timeless',
    //     rating: 4,
    //     reviewNotes: "Along with being an incredible movie, Jaws actually taught me a few things. I love it when that happens.The first time I saw Jaws I thought the shark looked fake. Then I watched it with a friend who told me that Great Whites really do look that way. This led me to pursue more info and develop a life-long fascination with sharks.I'm also embarrassed to say that I hadn't known anything about the USS Indianapolis. Quint's hard-hitting monologue inspired me to research the ship and what happened to it-- which was beyond horrific. Getting back to the movie itself, I think the performances of Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw are amazing. They literally become Brody, Hooper and Quint every time I watch Jaws. I think Robert Shaw does the best acting of his career. He's perfect as Quint.Jaws was made well before CGI came about, and I couldn't be happier about that. It feels so nice not to be clobbered with it."

        title: "You've got mail: My Favorite!!",
        rating: 5,
        reviewNotes: "My favorite Romantic Comedie hands down! I still cry at the end every time. I've seen this maybe 6 times over the years. The thing about it, and Sleepless in Seattle, same Producer (Nora Ephron, isn't it?) that really clinches it for me is the music. This film is lodged in memory first via the song 'Remember' by Harry Nielsson at such a poignant moment in the film ... but of all the films that slides along the feeling of the songs and renditions/singers of them, this one (and Sleepless in Seattle) is just a seamless mix of those two art forms and without that music it wouldn't have been nearly as good, touching, deeply felt. Tom and Meg just have some kind of chemistry in these two films mentioned that really plays well together and it was a very good story as well. I somehow always watch it around Christmas time. Very much a quality film, in my view, a classic."
