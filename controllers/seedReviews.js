	reviewNotes : "The entire series began well, became amazing, and then somewhere began to stumble, only to catch itself to keep from hitting the ground, ending upright, tall, and with much to be proud of. Few shows will ever hook us the way the Office characters did thanks to the outstanding performances of the best and most devoted ensemble of actors a television show could ever hope for.",
